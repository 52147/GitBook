## Subset

\[Z12 +12]

\[{0,6},+12]

\-{0,6} ⊆Z12? Yes

closure:

0∈{0,6}

6^-1 = 6

\[{0,4,8},+12] Yes

closure : Yes

\[{0,2,4,6,8,10}, +12]

\[{0,3,6,9},+12]

## subgroup

H is a subgroup of 6:

1\) H⊆6

2\) H is closed

3\) if x∈ H then x^-1∈H



\[Z12,+12]

\[{0,5,10,3,7},+12] No

No closure: 5+3 =8

|G|/|H| = K∈Z

1\) |G| = 12

2\) |H| = 2

3\) |H|=3



Lagrange states that if H exists (there exists a subgroup)

Thus |H| divides |G|



Lagrange does not granted the exists of a subgroup of any order that divides G.

|G| =20

|H| = 7

|H| = 10
