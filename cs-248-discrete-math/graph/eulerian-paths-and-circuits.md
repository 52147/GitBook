# Eulerian Paths and Circuits

* An **Eulerian **path in G is a simple path containing every edge of G.
* An **Eulerian **circuit in a graph G is a simple circuit containing every edge of G.
* The term **Eulerian graph** has two common meanings in graph theory. One meaning is a graph with an Eulerian circuit, and the other is a graph with every vertex of **even degree**. These definitions coincide for connected graphs.

![Every vertex of this graph has an even degree. Therefore, this is an Eulerian graph. Following the edges in alphabetical order gives an Eulerian circuit/cycle.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)
