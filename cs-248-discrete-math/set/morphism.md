# 🍧 Morphism

\[S,\*] &\[T,#]

monoid e1

monoid e2

The 2 monoids are Homomorphic if there exists a fct f: S-> T

1\) f(e1) = e2

2\) f(x\*y) = f(x) # f(y)

preservation  of operation

\[Z+,+] e1 = 0 monoid

\[N,1] e2 = 1 monoid

f(x) = x+3

f(e1)!= e2

f(0) = 0+3=3



f(n) =2^n  homomorphism?

1\) f(e1) = e2 -> f(0) = 2^0 = 1 = e^2

2\) f(n+m)=2^n+m = 2^n\*2^m = f(n) \*f(m)

f is a homomorphism

f is an isomorphism



f is bijective
