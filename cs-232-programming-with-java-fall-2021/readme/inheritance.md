# ðŸ˜— Inheritance

* Inheritance allows you to define a general class and then later define more specialized classes that add some new details to the existing general class definition.

## Derived class

* A derived class is a class defined by adding instance variables and methods to an existing class.
* The derived class extends the existing class.
* The existing class that the derived class is built upon is called the base class, or **super class.**
* **The derived class will inherits the super class's public member.**
